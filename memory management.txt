Memory life cycle
Regardless of the programming language, the memory life cycle is pretty much always the same:

1. Allocate the memory you need
2. Use the allocated memory (read, write)
3. Release the allocated memory when it is not needed anymore

In C/C++, we have to manually deallocate the used heap memory.
But in JS we need not deallocate the same, as the Garbage collector runs in the background using the mark and sweep algorithm
