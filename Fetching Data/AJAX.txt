1. AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): A set of web development techniques that enable web pages to fetch data asynchronously from a server without reloading the entire page.
2. It leverages a combination of JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects, and server-side technologies (e.g., JSON, XML, HTML, plain text) to exchange data with the server and update parts of the page dynamically.

(i) Asynchronous coomunication: AJAX allows data exchange between the browser and server in the background, without hindering UX
(ii) JavaScript: acts as a binding medium as it sends requests to the server, processes the received data and updates the web page dynamically (DOM manipulation)
(iii) XMLHttpRequest(XHR): This built-in browser object handles the communication between JavaScript and the server. It retrives data in formats like JSON, XML, etc.

3. Importance of AJAX:

(i) Enhanced responsiveness - Elimination of full page reloads
(ii) Improved UX - features like live search suggestions, auto-complete functionality, real-time chat applications, and dynamic content updates
(iii) Reduced server load - Only the necessary data is exchanged between the browser and server, minimizing unnecessary server requests and improving overall application performance.
