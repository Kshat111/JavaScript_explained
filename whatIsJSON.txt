1. PARSING: Parsing is a fundamental process in computing that involves analyzing and converting input data into a structured format that can be easily processed by a program. It plays a crucial role in data interchange, error detection, and the execution of code.
2. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format which is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse.
3. Uses objects and arrays as its syntax
4. Commonly used for data exchange between client and server, configuration files, and APIs.
5. JSON.parse() for parsing JSON strings into objects, and JSON.stringify() for converting objects to JSON strings.

for example,
a JSON object looks like this:

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false,
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown"
  },
  "phoneNumbers": [
    "123-456-7890",
    "987-654-3210"
  ]
}

6. BEFORE PARSING VS AFTER PARSING:

Before Parsing: The request body is a raw JSON string.
After Parsing: The request body is a parsed JavaScript object available on req.body.
